# BOXY 2.0

**Transform a firehose of captures into shipped work that matters.**

BOXY is a Notion-based AI agent system that acts as your thinking partner — with memory, taste, and opinions.

---

## What Is This?

Most "second brain" systems optimize for capture and organization. BOXY optimizes for **shipping**.

It's built for people who:
- Save more than they process
- Have ideas that never become anything
- Know they should write/create more but don't
- Want an AI partner that pushes back, not just agrees

## The System

```
CAPTURE          SYNTHESIZE         DEVELOP            SHIP
┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐       ┌─────────┐       ┌─────────┐
│ ⚡Sparks │      │         │       │         │       │         │

└─────────┘      └─────────┘       └─────────┘       └─────────┘
```

**7 Databases:**
- ⚡ **Sparks** — Micro-captures (quotes, thoughts, observations)
- 📥 **Flow** — Standard captures (articles, videos, notes)
- 🎯 **Sources** — Recurring inputs (newsletters, podcasts, people)
- 🔮 **Lenses** — Living patterns that connect content
- 💡 **Ideas** — Concepts being developed toward output
- 🎯 **Projects** — Groups of Ideas toward larger goals
- 📤 **Outputs** — Finished, shipped work

## The Agent

BOXY isn't just a database. It's an AI agent with:

**6 Operating Modes:**
| Mode | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| 🌊 Triage | Rapid-fire inbox processing |
| 🔮 Synthesis | Find patterns, surface connections |
| 🔨 Development | Build out specific Ideas |
| 👹 Critique | Pressure-test and challenge |
| 🚀 Ship | Focus only on finishing |
| 📊 Review | Weekly/monthly retrospective |

**Proactive Intelligence:**
- Notices contradictions in your captures
- Alerts when Ideas are stalling
- Surfaces emerging patterns before you see them
- Tracks source quality over time
- Pushes you to ship

**Memory:**
- Learns your taste profile
- Remembers what works and what dies
- Adapts to your working patterns
- Gets sharper over time

## Files in This Repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BOXY-2.0-DESIGN.md` | Complete database architecture and schema |
| `BOXY-2.0-AGENT.md` | Full AI agent instructions (paste into Notion AI) |
| `BOXY-2.0-HOMEPAGE.md` | Template for BOXY dashboard page |
| `BOXY-2.0-ONBOARDING.md` | 20-minute onboarding experience |
| `BOXY 1.0 files` | Original template (legacy) |

## Setup

### Quick Start
1. Create the 7 databases in Notion with schemas from `BOXY-2.0-DESIGN.md`
2. Create a BOXY homepage using `BOXY-2.0-HOMEPAGE.md`
3. Add the agent instructions from `BOXY-2.0-AGENT.md` to your Notion AI custom instructions
4. Say "Setup BOXY" to run the onboarding

### The Onboarding
The onboarding (`BOXY-2.0-ONBOARDING.md`) takes ~20 minutes and covers:
- Your consumption habits and sources
- How you think and what interests you
- Your work patterns and blockers
- Your goals and aspirational work
- ...and recommends a playlist for your first session

## Philosophy

1. **Capture is free, synthesis is expensive** — make capture effortless, invest in synthesis
2. **Ship over perfect** — shipped 80% beats unshipped 100%
3. **Patterns over items** — individual captures matter less than what they reveal
4. **Memory creates leverage** — tracking what works compounds over time
5. **Challenge creates clarity** — the best ideas survive criticism
6. **Energy is signal** — trust your gut about what's hot
7. **Close the loop** — track outputs to learn what resonates

## Voice

BOXY is:
- **Direct** — no hedging, no fluff
- **Opinionated** — has views, pushes back
- **Focused on shipping** — allergic to perfectionism
- **Sharp** — asks pointed questions
- **Honest** — says when something isn't working

BOXY is not:
- A yes-machine
- A filing system
- Impressed by volume
- Patient with endless polishing
