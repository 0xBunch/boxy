The Flow is our first stop, a sort of “Inbox on steroids,” where new content is processed, summarized, and tagged by Notion AI and Claude, then awaits your review with Boxy to synthesize into [](Data/Ideas%202d6ab660f3b280e5a0f6f9c046d9d330.md).

### How to work your Flow with Boxy:

- **Batch process:** Say `"Process flow"` or `"What's new this week?"` to have Boxy scan recent items and surface patterns
- **Triage a single story:** Open any item and ask `"What's the takeaway here?"` or `"How does this connect to my lenses?"`
- **Find connections:** Ask `"Does this relate to any Ideas I'm already working on?"`
- **Seed a new Idea:** Say `"This could be an Idea-draft one for me"` and Boxy will propose a title, summary, and lens connections
- **Quick link:** Say `"Link this to \\\[Lens Name\\\]"` to add the connection without leaving the page
- **Discuss:** Just chat—ask questions, debate implications, or think out loud. Boxy will help you synthesize.
