What Notion 3.0 Signals About Personal AI Agents,Analysis piece on the implications of Notion 3.0's agentic AI for knowledge workers and personal productivity systems.,"Introducing Notion 3.0 (Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5/Introducing%20Notion%203%200%202d7ab660f3b281a694c1eb3f48802d7d.md), Notion launches agents for data analysis and task automation | TechCrunch (Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5/Notion%20launches%20agents%20for%20data%20analysis%20and%20task%20%202d7ab660f3b281e1b709cc659a7f0768.md), Using Claude inside Notion AI (Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5/Using%20Claude%20inside%20Notion%20AI%202d7ab660f3b28074a2e9e32c7526168c.md)",,Agentic Productivity (Data/Lenses/Agentic%20Productivity%2003397e105abe4e19a52daebbb879f1fc.md),Idea,"Notion 3.0 isn't just a product update—it's a declaration about where personal productivity is headed. The shift from 'AI that answers' to 'AI that acts' represents a fundamental change in how we relate to our tools. When your agent can create databases, synthesize across sources, and execute 20-minute autonomous workflows, the bottleneck moves from execution to intention. The question is no longer 'how do I do this?' but 'what should be done?'","A reflective essay or blog post exploring what Notion's agent launch reveals about the trajectory of personal AI. Could examine: the blurring line between tool and teammate, what 'memory' and 'personality' mean for AI, and whether agentic productivity liberates us or just raises the bar.",
Building Your Own Agentic Workflow Stack,Practical framework for designing personal AI agent workflows that handle multi-step processes autonomously.,"Introducing Notion 3.0 (Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5/Introducing%20Notion%203%200%202d7ab660f3b281a694c1eb3f48802d7d.md), Notion launches agents for data analysis and task automation | TechCrunch (Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5/Notion%20launches%20agents%20for%20data%20analysis%20and%20task%20%202d7ab660f3b281e1b709cc659a7f0768.md), Using Claude inside Notion AI (Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5/Using%20Claude%20inside%20Notion%20AI%202d7ab660f3b28074a2e9e32c7526168c.md)",,Agentic Productivity (Data/Lenses/Agentic%20Productivity%2003397e105abe4e19a52daebbb879f1fc.md),Idea,"The tools are here—Notion agents, Claude, custom GPTs, Zapier, Make. But most people are still using them like souped-up assistants. The real unlock is designing workflows where AI agents handle entire loops: intake → processing → output → notification. This piece would map out a practical framework for building your own agentic stack, using ECOS/Boxy as a case study.","A how-to guide or framework for readers who want to move beyond chatbot interactions into genuine agentic workflows. Practical, opinionated, with a working example (Boxy + Flow → Ideas pipeline). Could become a series: Part 1 on principles, Part 2 on tooling, Part 3 on maintenance and iteration.",
