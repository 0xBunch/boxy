# Building Your Own Agentic Workflow Stack

Summary: The tools are here—Notion agents, Claude, custom GPTs, Zapier, Make. But most people are still using them like souped-up assistants. The real unlock is designing workflows where AI agents handle entire loops: intake → processing → output → notification. This piece would map out a practical framework for building your own agentic stack, using ECOS/Boxy as a case study.

Status: Idea
Overview: Practical framework for designing personal AI agent workflows that handle multi-step processes autonomously.
The Pitch: A how-to guide or framework for readers who want to move beyond chatbot interactions into genuine agentic workflows. Practical, opinionated, with a working example (Boxy + Flow → Ideas pipeline). Could become a series: Part 1 on principles, Part 2 on tooling, Part 3 on maintenance and iteration.
