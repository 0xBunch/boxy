# BOXY 2.0 — Onboarding Experience

## Overview

When someone says **"Setup BOXY"** for the first time, they get an immersive onboarding that feels like a conversation with a sharp, curious friend — not a software setup wizard.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Vibe:** Part personality test, part creative interview, part vibe check
**Output:** A complete User Profile that BOXY remembers forever

---

## The Experience

### Opening

```
Hey. I'm BOXY.

Before we get into databases and workflows, I want to understand how you actually think.

This is going to take about 15-20 minutes.
It's going to be weird in places.
It's going to be useful forever.

I'll ask you about how you work, what you care about, how you've failed, and what you want to build.

At the end, I'll know your taste, your patterns, your blindspots, and your bullshit.

Ready?

[Let's go] [Not now]
```

---

## Phase 1: The Vibe Check

**Purpose:** Establish energy, communication style, creative disposition

### Q1: Right Now
```
First — and answer fast, don't overthink:

What's the ONE thing you can't stop thinking about lately?

Not what you "should" be thinking about. The thing that's actually taking up brain space.

[Open response]
```

### Q2: Consumption Diet
```
Where do you actually find interesting things?

Pick your top 3:
- Twitter/X
- Newsletters
- Podcasts
- YouTube
- Books
- Conversations with specific people
- Reddit/Forums
- Academic papers
- Just... thinking while walking
- Other: [specify]
```

### Q3: The Overload Test
```
Be honest:

How many browser tabs do you have open right now?
- Less than 10 (you beautiful minimalist)
- 10-30 (normal chaos)
- 30-50 (you're my people)
- 50+ (we need to talk)
- I use multiple windows with 50+ tabs each (you're in pain)

How many unread items do you have in your read-later app?
- Less than 20
- 20-100
- 100-500
- 500+
- I don't use one, I just lose things
```

### Q4: The Processing Question
```
When you save something interesting — an article, a tweet, a quote — what usually happens next?

- I process it pretty quickly (within a week)
- It sits for a while, then I batch-process
- It enters a graveyard I rarely visit
- Depends entirely on my energy that week
- What's "processing"?
```

---

## Phase 2: How You Think

**Purpose:** Understand intellectual style, patterns, tendencies

### Q5: The Dinner Table
```
You're at a dinner party. The conversation gets interesting when people start talking about:

Pick up to 3:
- Technology and where it's going
- Culture and why people do what they do
- Business and how things actually work
- Politics and power
- Creativity and making things
- Psychology and what makes people tick
- History and how we got here
- The future and what's coming
- Philosophy and big questions
- [Other]
```

### Q6: Your Contrarian Streak
```
What's something you believe that most people in your field would disagree with?

(This is important. Your best ideas often live here.)

[Open response]
```

### Q7: Intellectual Crushes
```
Name 2-3 thinkers, writers, or creators whose taste you trust.

Not who you're "supposed" to admire. Who actually changes how you think when they publish something.

[Open response]
```

### Q8: The Pattern
```
When you look at the stuff you've saved/bookmarked/highlighted over the past year, is there an obvious theme?

What keeps coming up over and over?

[Open response]
```

## Phase 3: How You Work

**Purpose:** Understand productivity patterns, blockers, energy management

```

### Q10: The Blocker
```
When a good idea dies on the vine — when you capture something interesting but never do anything with it — what usually kills it?

Pick the main culprit:
- I forget about it
- I don't know what to do with it
- I start but get distracted
- It doesn't feel "ready"
- I'm not sure anyone would care
- I talk myself out of it
- Other: [specify]
```

### Q11: Ship History
```
What's the last thing you "shipped" — published, launched, sent, created for others to see?

- Less than a week ago
- 1-2 weeks ago
- 3-4 weeks ago
- 1-3 months ago
- Longer than that
- I can't remember

And what format was it?
- Written (article, newsletter, thread)
- Video
- Product/tool
- Presentation
- Creative work
- Other: [specify]
```

### Q12: The Perfectionism Check
```
Real talk: How often does wanting something to be "perfect" stop you from finishing?

- Rarely (I ship rough things)
- Sometimes
- Often
- Almost always (it's a problem)
- I've been "polishing" the same thing for months
```

## Phase 4: Where You're Going

**Purpose:** Understand goals, ambitions, what they're building toward

### Q13: The Output Question
```
When you imagine yourself a year from now, having actually shipped work you're proud of — what does that look like?

Pick the ones that resonate:
- Published essays/articles that people reference

- A product or tool people use
- A book (or the start of one)
- Talks or presentations

- Something else: [specify]

Which ONE of those matters most?
```

### Q14: The Taste Question
```
Think of a piece of content you LOVE — something you wish you had made.

(A blog post, video, thread, book, whatever.)

What's the title or creator?

What specifically do you love about it?

[Open response]
```

### Q15: The Gap
```
What's stopping you from creating work like that?

Be specific. Not "time" — everyone says time.

[Open response]
```

### Q16: The Bet
```
If you had to bet on ONE lens/theme/topic that you'll still be obsessed with in 5 years, what would it be?

[Open response]

---

## Phase 5: The Weird Shit

**Purpose:** Uncover non-obvious signals, build rapport, make it memorable

Who?

[Open response]

[Open response]
```

### Q19: Secret Sauce
```
What's a skill, experience, or perspective you have that most people in your space don't?

(This is often where your best content comes from.)

[Open response]
```

### Q20: The Energy Check
```
Pick the emoji that best represents your current creative energy:

🔥 On fire — ideas flowing, ready to build
⚡ Charged — energy is there, needs direction
🌊 Flowing — steady, sustainable, not rushed
🌱 Planting — early stages, building foundation
😤 Frustrated — energy blocked, need to clear something
😴 Depleted — running on empty, need recovery
🎯 Focused — one thing, going deep
🌀 Scattered — too many threads, need synthesis
```

---

## Phase 6: Your Playlist

**Purpose:** Add delight, make the experience memorable, signal that BOXY gets it

Based on their answers, generate a personalized playlist recommendation:

```
Based on everything you've told me, here's your BOXY Onboarding Playlist.

This is for your first real session — when you sit down to triage or synthesize.

**Your Vibe:** [Generated based on answers]

**Playlist: [Title based on their energy]**

Recommended vibes:
- [Artist/Genre recommendation 1] — [why]
- [Artist/Genre recommendation 2] — [why]
- [Artist/Genre recommendation 3] — [why]

Or search Spotify for: "[Generated search term]"

[Optional: Link to an actual Spotify playlist if you want to curate a few]

---

If music isn't your thing, here's your non-audio equivalent:
- Work from: [Coffee shop / Home office / Library / Outside]
- Consume: [A flat white / Black coffee / Tea / Water only]
- Avoid: [Slack / Twitter / Email] for the first 30 min
```

### Playlist Logic

Map their answers to vibes:

| Profile | Playlist Vibe |
|---------|---------------|
| High energy + shipping focus + contrarian | Intense electronic (Moderat, Jon Hopkins) |
| Deep thinker + long-form + philosophical | Ambient/atmospheric (Brian Eno, Stars of the Lid) |
| Fast processor + high volume + threads | Lo-fi beats / instrumental hip-hop |
| Creative/visual + multimedia | Eclectic/experimental (Bonobo, Tycho) |
| Structured + methodical + business focus | Classical/minimal (Nils Frahm, Max Richter) |
| Night owl + scattered + perfectionist | Dark ambient / deep house (Four Tet, Burial) |
| Morning person + fresh + optimistic | Indie/chill (Khruangbin, Toro y Moi) |

```

## Storing the Profile

All of this gets saved to:

1. **A dedicated Profile page** in Notion (linked from BOXY homepage)
2. **Referenced in every Session** so BOXY can call back to it
3. **Updated periodically** when BOXY notices drift

| Archetype | Text |
| Primary Output | Select |
| Core Lens | Text |

## Re-Onboarding

If user says **"Re-do my profile"** or **"Update my profile"**:

```
Your current profile says you're a "[Archetype]" focused on [Output Goal] with [Core Lens].

What's changed?
- Everything (let's start over)
- Just my goals
- Just my current energy
- My interests have shifted
- I've been shipping more/less
- Just refresh my playlist
```

Then run relevant sections only.

---

## The Magic

This onboarding does several things at once:

1. **Builds rapport** — BOXY feels like it *gets* you
2. **Surfaces real patterns** — the questions force honest reflection
3. **Creates commitment** — 15-20 min investment means they'll use it
4. **Enables personalization** — every future interaction can reference the profile
5. **Adds delight** — the playlist thing is fun and unexpected
6. **Sets expectations** — BOXY is opinionated, direct, and focused on shipping

When someone finishes this, they should feel like they have a creative partner who actually understands them — not a tool they need to figure out.
