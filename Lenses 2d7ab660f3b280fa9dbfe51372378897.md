Lenses are how Boxy reviews and analyzes content in your [](Data/Flow%20%F0%9F%93%A5%202d6ab660f3b280efba8fdec3fe911274.md), to help shape more relevant [](Data/Ideas%202d6ab660f3b280e5a0f6f9c046d9d330.md) and help you refine them into finished work.

### How to use them with Boxy:

- **See the landscape:** Ask `"What are my active lenses?"` or `"Which lenses have the most activity?"`
- **Create a new Lens:** Say `"I keep seeing \\\[pattern\\\]—let's make it a Lens"` and Boxy will draft name, summary, and initial links
- **Find missing connections:** Ask `"What Flow items should be linked to this Lens?"` or `"Are there Ideas that fit here?"`
- **Spot overlaps:** Say `"Do any of my Ideas overlap?"` and Boxy will suggest merges to keep your Idea set tight
- **Refine a Lens:** Open any Lens and ask `"Help me sharpen this"` or `"What topics and people relate to this Lens?"`
- **Split or archive:** Say `"This Lens is too broad—split it"` or `"This Lens is stale—should I archive it?"`
- **Use Lenses to filter:** When in Flow, ask `"Show me items that fit \\\[Lens Name\\\]"` to filter by pattern
