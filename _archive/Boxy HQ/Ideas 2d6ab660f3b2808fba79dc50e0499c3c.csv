What Notion 3.0 Signals About Personal AI Agents,"Notion 3.0 isn't just a product update—it's a declaration about where personal productivity is headed. The shift from 'AI that answers' to 'AI that acts' represents a fundamental change in how we relate to our tools. When your agent can create databases, synthesize across sources, and execute 20-minute autonomous workflows, the bottleneck moves from execution to intention. The question is no longer 'how do I do this?' but 'what should be done?'",Agentic Productivity (Data/Lenses/Agentic%20Productivity%2003397e105abe4e19a52daebbb879f1fc.md)

The real unlock is designing workflows where AI agents handle entire loops: intake → processing → output → notification. This piece would map out a practical framework for building your own agentic stack, using ECOS/Boxy as a case study.",Agentic Productivity (Data/Lenses/Agentic%20Productivity%2003397e105abe4e19a52daebbb879f1fc.md)
