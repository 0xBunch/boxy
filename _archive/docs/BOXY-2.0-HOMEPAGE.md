## Setup BOXY

Say **"Setup BOXY"** to configure database mappings and preferences.

Say **"Help"** to see all available commands.

Say **"What should I work on?"** for a contextual recommendation.

## Philosophy

1. **Capture is free, synthesis is expensive** — make capture effortless, invest in synthesis
2. **Ship over perfect** — shipped 80% beats unshipped 100%
3. **Patterns over items** — individual captures matter less than what they reveal together
4. **Memory creates leverage** — tracking what works compounds over time
5. **Challenge creates clarity** — the best ideas survive criticism
6. **Energy is signal** — trust your gut about what's hot
7. **Close the loop** — track outputs to learn what resonates
